## Break the Ice with LLMs: Personalized Conversation Starters

This project focuses on fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) using Hugging Face to generate personalized conversation starters based on user **Bios** and **Interests**. I also explore **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, a reinforcement learning method, using human feedback as the reward signal to further refine the model's output quality.

## Project Overview

### Goals
- Fine-tune a pretrained **GPT-Neo 1.3B** model to generate conversation starters based on Bios and Interests.
- Implement **Reinforcement Learning (PPO)** with human feedback to improve the response quality, making the outputs more engaging and natural.
- Tackle challenges like repetition, lack of coherence, and creating conversational diversity.

### Key Features
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuned the **GPT-Neo 1.3B** model using Hugging Face transformers to generate personalized conversation starters.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implemented **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**, a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm, using human feedback as the reward system.
- **Creative & Task-Specific**: The project focuses on generating conversation starters for creative fields like dating apps, chatbots, and virtual assistants, where user engagement and creativity are key.

### Technologies Used
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For model fine-tuning and generation.
- **GPT-Neo 1.3B (EleutherAI)**: The base model used for fine-tuning.
- **Reinforcement Learning (PPO)**: A method to further optimize generated responses based on human feedback.
- **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for implementing the model.

## Approach

### 1. Fine-Tuning
The pretrained **GPT-Neo 1.3B** model was fine-tuned using a dataset consisting of **Bios**, **Interests**, and corresponding **conversation starters**. I focused on ensuring that the generated outputs were not repetitive and aligned with the context provided by the bio and interests of the individual.

### 2. Reinforcement Learning (PPO)
After fine-tuning, I explored **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** to further refine the model's output. PPO uses human feedback as a reward signal to guide the model towards generating more natural and engaging conversation starters. This step also allowed for some flexibility in the generated responses, avoiding common issues like repetition or incoherence.

### 3. Challenges
- **Repetition**: Avoiding the same conversation starter for different bios.
- **Coherence**: Ensuring that the generated conversation starters were relevant and fit within the context of the bio and interests provided.
- **Creativity**: Balancing coherence with creativity to make the conversation starters engaging.

## Evaluation

### Metrics
This project explores various metrics for evaluating the generated conversation starters:
- **Cosine Similarity**: To measure the similarity between the generated and true conversation starters.
- **BLEU Score**: A common metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated text.
- **BERTScore**: A metric based on transformer embeddings for evaluating semantic similarity.
- **Human Evaluation**: Essential in creative tasks, human feedback was used to guide the model's reinforcement learning process and reward model.

While metrics like cosine similarity and BLEU are useful, they have limitations in creative fields where **human evaluation** is crucial for determining the quality of generated content.

## Results

### Fine-Tuning
The fine-tuned model was able to generate conversation starters that aligned well with the provided bios and interests. Issues such as repetition and lack of creativity were mitigated to an extent, but still posed challenges.

### Reinforcement Learning (PPO)
Although **PPO** didnâ€™t yield significantly better results than fine-tuning in some cases, it opened up avenues for exploring **human-in-the-loop** systems, where human feedback can be used to refine creative outputs.

## Next Steps
- **Optimize Reward Models**: Further refinement of the reward models to better capture human preferences and feedback.
- **Explore Alternative RL Methods**: Explore more advanced RL techniques to see if they can yield better results in creative content generation.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Systems**: Focus on systems where human evaluators can continually provide feedback to guide the model towards better outputs.
